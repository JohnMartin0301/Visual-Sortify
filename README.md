-> Randomize the array to experience sorting from scratch.

-> Aesthetic and sleek user interface.





## Sorting Algorithms
-> Bubble Sort
   
   Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong         order.

-> Merge Sort
   
   Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the unsorted list into smaller sublists and then merging     those sublists in a sorted manner.

-> Heap Sort
   
   Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to build a max-heap and then repeatedly extracts the maximum         element to sort the array.

-> Insertion Sort
   
   Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more        advanced algorithms such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort.

-> Quick Sort
   
   Quick Sort is a highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to partition the array into smaller sub-arrays      and sort them.
